A collection of experiments I built to learn about generative art using Perlin noise, Fractal subdivision, and different calculations.  
I didn't plan to put this online at first but I got some pretty cool results so I think it's worth it!

## How to view the results
Some commits have a message that describes the shapes generated at that point.  
Go to that commit, and when you open the index.html file you should see that specific result.

I'm using the live-server (five-server) extension in VSCode to host locally, since you can't load the JS files when just opening the html file in your browser.
